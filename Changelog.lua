	{
		version = "0.9.0",
		date = "13 November 2026",
		sections = {
			{ "New", {
				{ "A light beam on your bobber.", "Turn on Mark your bobber and your bobber glows, with a column of light rising from it while the line is out and ripples on the water, so it stands out on busy water. It takes your theme's colour, or pick your own under Beam colour, including any colour you like with Custom (or /onecast beam). Marker chooses the beam, the glow alone, the game's gear icon, or the beam and the icon." },
				{ "Themes with a sense of place.", "Each theme now brings its own scenery along the foot of every window, from Frostfire Ridge's snow to Blackrock Mountain, with particles drifting over it: snow on Winterspring, bubbles on Tidal and Murloc, embers on Ember, fireflies on Marsh and Moonlit, gold glints on Booty Bay. Each has an emblem in the window's title bar and its own water in the Fishing bar: molten metal on Ember, Alchemy's bubbling green on Deviate. Theme effects in the options keeps them still, or turns them off." },
				{ "Mini mode.", "A small window in place of the stats while you fish: your skill, how the zone suits it in plain words, catches and fish per hour, your lure and your goals. It follows your theme. Turn it on under Stats window, or /onecast mini." },
				{ "Skill-ups and what to catch next.", "When your Fishing goes up, +1 Fishing rises and fades on screen, over the mini bar if it's open. The Session tab has a Catch next line: the likeliest fish you're missing in a zone your skill already covers, here if there is one. Hover it for every one, click it to see them in the collection." },
				{ "Fishing Extravaganza help.", "While the contest runs, the mini bar shows your Tastyfish and the time left, and holding 40 sets a waypoint to Riggle Bassbait in Booty Bay. /onecast riggle sets it any time." },
				{ "Hide the tabs you don't use.", "Right-click a side tab to hide it; right-click any tab to bring them back. Options always stays." },
				{ "Catch goals.", "Right-click any catch and set a goal, like 20 Stonescale Eels. Progress shows on its row and in mini mode, with a note halfway and an alert when you get there." },
				{ "What's in a pool.", "Hover a fishing pool and its tooltip lists what it gives, with Classic's odds, and marks what you haven't caught yet." },
				{ "A fisherman's journey.", "A new page for the four Fishing ranks, Apprentice to Artisan: where you stand, how far to your cap in catches, and for each rank how and where to learn it, what it needs, and where to fish while you're at it. Expert's book from Old Man Heming in Booty Bay and Nat Pagle's Artisan quest each have a map waypoint, and Nat's four fish are ticked off as you catch them. Its Gear view lists every fishing pole and piece of fishing gear, from the plain Fishing Pole to the Arcanite Fishing Pole and Forever's Master Angler's Fishing Hat: its Fishing bonus, whether you have it, and where it comes from. /onecast journey opens it." },
				{ "A fishing wardrobe.", "A new page, laid out like the character sheet with you in the middle wearing it, to choose what you fish in: for each slot, the best Fishing bonus in your bags, an item you pick, or what you're wearing, and which pole. It goes on whenever the cast key puts your pole on, or with Wear it now, and comes off with your weapons. /onecast wardrobe opens it." },
				{ "Session history.", "All-time records has a Sessions list: each past session's date, zone, catches and fish per hour, with its time, gold, skill gained and best catch on hover." },
				{ "In reach, on the map and at the vendor.", "Showing: in reach in the collection lists the fish you're missing in zones your skill already covers. The world map shows a zone's fishing level, how your skill stands and your fish caught there, and follows the zone under the mouse on a continent. At a vendor, one click sells the grey junk you fished up and nothing else, or turn on selling it automatically." },
				{ "A new Options page.", "One category at a time, chosen down the left, with each setting's full description, its value and its chat command on the right as you hover it. No more hunting for tooltips." },
				{ "Naowh Forever's auction prices.", "Auction value and gold per hour now work with Naowh Forever's prices too, from its own scans and the prices it comes with, alongside Auctionator and TSM. The auction tooltips say which addon the prices come from, and with more than one installed, Auction prices from in the options picks which to use. Thanks to Zycko for asking!" },
				{ "More treasure.", "The Mithril Bound, Iron Bound and Watertight Trunks from Floating Wreckage join the Treasure tab, and the Rockhide Strongfish joins the trophies." },
			} },
			{ "Changed", {
				{ "Switch off what you don't use.", "Every feature that shows or says something has its own setting: item tooltips, pool tooltips and the world map strip separately (General, under Tooltips and map), the green dots on the tabs, the rare-catch sound, catch goal alerts, the new-for-your-collection line, and fishing junk at vendors (a button, selling automatically, or neither)." },
				{ "Plainer words.", "The zone's status says what it means everywhere: No fish get away instead of Ready, 12 skill short, None got away yet, Watching for getaways." },
				{ "A data report worth sharing.", "It flags anything you fish up that the collection doesn't have (not just fish), the first Forever catch of something OneCast only knew from Classic, where a Blueprint drops, and for the Fisherman's journey: where you learn a Fishing rank, Find Fish or Bait and Tackle (the trainer or quest), and fishing gear it doesn't list, with where it came from. Nothing to share means no report to copy, and a page that says what to look out for." },
				{ "In every language.", "On German, French, Spanish, Russian, Korean and Chinese clients, pools are now recognised by the names you see on the water, for their tooltips and marks, and shown by those names wherever OneCast says where a catch's odds are best. The fishing outfit reads the Fishing bonus in your client's language, and the data report knows a fishing message in it. Zones, sub-zones and dungeons already followed your client's names." },
				{ "An easier What's new.", "Each version's notes are laid out to read at a glance: every section in its own colour, each change's headline on its own line with the details under it, and the version you have marked Installed in the list." },
			} },
			{ "Fixed", {
				{ "Remembering pools.", "Moving the mouse from the water straight onto a pool often went unnoticed, so its spot wasn't marked on the map. OneCast now sees every pool's tooltip as the game fills it." },
				{ "The item menu.", "Right-clicking a catch opened a see-through menu with the list showing through it. It's solid now, and as wide as its longest line." },
				{ "Snappier tooltips and collection.", "A catch's rarity is worked out once instead of on every tooltip and redraw." },
			} },
			{ "Reported by DevanHyrax", {
				{ "The Fishing Hut's Blueprint.", "Reported to drop from Jammal'an the Prophet in the Sunken Temple. The Camp tab says so, as not yet confirmed, and the data report now notes where any Blueprint drops." },
			} },
			{ "Reported by Roezz", {
				{ "The Mithril Bound Trunk.", "Fished up in Tanaris, it wasn't in the collection. That led to a check of everything Classic's fishing can give, which found three more." },
			} },
			{ "Reported by user_hzctcyub5il0ubj3", {
				{ "Zephras Isle needs 25.", "Ten catches at skill 0-24 and none got away, with the starting zones' fish." },
			} },
			{ "Reported by user_wwbl1xmh9xl6rbb7", {
				{ "City of Dalaran.", "Fished in Forever, it now has a place on the Zones tab while its level is worked out." },
			} },
		},
	},
	{
		version = "0.8.2",
		date = "13 November 2026",
		sections = {
			{ "New", {
				{ "Treasure in the collection.", "A new Treasure tab for what you fish up besides fish: The 1 Ring from the city canals, the Tightly Sealed Trunk, the Rumsey Rums (Light, Dark and Black Label), Message in a Bottle, the Broken Wine Bottle, and every chest and crate, from the Battered Chest to the Reinforced Locked Chest. Tangy Clam Meat joins the special catches. Each has its own page with where it's found, and treasure you've already caught counts. Thanks to DevanHyrax for the idea!" },
				{ "A roomier page for each catch.", "Every zone it's found in now shows, in two columns, with your catches there and the Fishing each needs. A fish found almost everywhere has a +N more that opens the rest. The map is bigger, filling the page in its own shape, and the recipes moved across to the left page." },
				{ "Easier to use all round.", "Right-click any catch, on the stats pages or in the collection, for one menu with everything you can do with it: open it in the collection, where it bites best, mark it as wanted, its Wowhead page or a chat link. A plain click opens it in the collection. The stats page's lists scroll with the mouse wheel instead of stopping at \"and N more\". Rare catches wear a gem in the collection, with a Showing: rare filter. Every character shows under Your catches, everything caught with a camp buff shows on the Camp tab, the data report gives its text more room when there's nothing new, and the tackle box shows fish per hour as tiles, with what a lure adds." },
				{ "Wowhead links all through the collection.", "Right-click any fish or treasure in the book, or anything you can hover on its pages and the Camp tab (reagents, recipes, campfires), for its WoW Forever page on Wowhead, ready to copy. Each page also has a Wowhead button, and Shift-click links a catch in chat." },
				{ "How rare is it?", "Every catch now has a rarity, from Common to Very rare, with its odds per catch and where they're best: The 1 Ring is about 1 in 2,000 in the city canals, the 103 Pound Mightfish 1 in 10,000. It shows on each page, with each zone's own odds when you hover it, and how often your own character has caught it. These are Classic's odds from its loot tables: Forever's aren't published." },
				{ "Rarity and who caught it, on item tooltips.", "Anything in the collection now says on its tooltip how rare it is and which of your characters caught it, wherever you see it: your bags, chat links, the auction house. Turn it off under General in the options." },
			} },
			{ "Fixed", {
				{ "Ready for the game's newer APIs.", "Lure timers, learned camp recipes, rare-catch alerts and chat links now use the game's current functions, so they keep working for players who turn off the game's old-API fallbacks, and after Blizzard removes them." },
				{ "A fairer \"level may be lower\" finding.", "Catches just under a zone's level no longer count as a sign the level is lower: fish rarely get away that close to it either way. The data report now flags a zone only when getaways were to be expected." },
			} },
			{ "Reported by user_6zyawui5bf5c0btl", {
				{ "Stormwind City confirmed at 75.", "A third of fish got away at skill 25-49, as a level of 75 would have it, and none in 22 catches from 50." },
			} },
		},
	},
	{
		version = "0.8.1",
		date = "12 November 2026",
		sections = {
			{ "New", {
				{ "More places to catch each fish.", "Wowhead's WoW Forever pages now include Forever's own catches, so 36 fish in the collection gained zones. Among them are Forever's own Zephras Isle, for Raw Brilliant Smallfish and the 10, 12 and 15 Pound Mud Snappers, and Riverglades, for Stonescale Eel, Firefin Snapper and Raw Greater Sagefish. The Session tab's \"not caught yet\" list and the book's zone pages follow." },
			} },
			{ "Fixed", {
				{ "Older catches in the data report.", "A zone fished before 0.7.0, when catches weren't yet recorded by skill, now shows its catches and getaways in the report instead of nothing." },
				{ "Fewer stray messages in the data report.", "\"Target not in line of sight\" is no longer kept as a fishing message." },
				{ "Resizing the window.", "Closing the window while dragging its corner now ends the resize there, instead of carrying on." },
			} },
			{ "Reported by bertas88", {
				{ "The Barrens needs 100.", "Fish got away at skill 75-99 though Classic's level is 75, so OneCast now lists Forever's own." },
			} },
			{ "Reported by user_h2k2opfztmgqkcf2", {
				{ "The Barrens confirmed at 100.", "Fish got away at 75-99 here too, and not once in 33 catches from 100." },

			{ "New", {
				{ "One window for everything.", "The stats window, tackle box, collection, Camp, data report, What's new and options now open as one window, with side tabs down its right edge to move between them. Every page is the same height and follows the Window scale setting, it opens where you last left it, and dragging any page moves the whole window. The tabs can go on the left instead, in the options." },
				{ "A new stats window.", "Three tabs instead of four. Session has this session with fish, vendor gold and auction gold per hour, your skill's progress with time to the next point and your rank's cap, and each fish's share of the catch, then the zone's fish you haven't caught yet. Spots shows whether this zone is worth it, with its spots best first. Pick a fish, or Ctrl-click one anywhere, to see where it bites best. All-time records keeps your personal bests and notable catches." },
				{ "Forever's own Fishing bar.", "The stats window's skill bar is now the professions window's own, its water flowing, with a status strip under it: the zone, the Fishing it needs and whether you're ready, at a glance. Hover it for the details." },
				{ "A clearer data report.", "The report window is smaller, in three parts: what you've found, three steps to share it with the button and links right in them, and the text itself. The text keeps to what OneCast can learn from: what's new, the evidence for zone levels, and camp buffs. Zones that only agree with OneCast's level, cast totals and every fish caught are gone, and a known fish caught in one more zone no longer counts as something new." },
				{ "A window that keeps up.", "Green dots on the side tabs when there's something to share or a version to read. The stats close themselves when your weapons go back on, if they opened when you cast, and can fade while you fish. Lock the window so it can't be moved by accident, and a new key binding opens it on the page you last used. A /reload brings back the page you had open, and resetting a session asks first." },
				{ "Five new themes.", "Booty Bay, in sea-worn verdigris and sand. Murloc, in bright aqua and an orange fin. Winterspring, frosted silver-blue. Deviate, purple with a toxic green glow. Ember, charcoal lit by Un'Goro's hot springs. Pick one under Options, or /onecast theme." },
				{ "Every option in the window.", "The Options tab has every OneCast setting, in two columns as wide as the collection and in the same order as the game's options, so you don't need to leave the window. Settings that belong to another are indented, and greyed out while it's off. Only your cast key is set in the game's options, one click away under Key bindings." },

			{ "Fixed", {
				{ "The pole not going back on.", "If you cast from your action bar after OneCast put your pole on, OneCast could later decide the pole couldn't be equipped: after your weapons went back on, the key would put your other pole on, or none at all. 0.7.2 already stopped the worst of it, and now nothing is held over between sessions. Thanks to user_1u9o7vfe00qi4c4k47561 for the report!" },

It now waits longer, keeps trying, and finishes a swap that lands late. Thanks to xDevastation1988x for the report!" },
				{ "A key stuck on reeling.", "If the game ever didn't say a cast had ended, after a loading screen or a disconnect, your key could stay on reeling in and never cast again until a reload. OneCast now checks, and gives it back." },
				{ "A second lure on a slow server.", "With Apply with the cast key on, a lure slow to show on your pole could be taken for none, and the next press would spend another. OneCast now waits for it." },

				{ "Camp buffs.", "The stats window shows Uncommon or Rare Fishing from a Rack or Hut with its time left, and chat says when it wears off. What you catch while one is on is kept, to show what their extra rewards really are." },
				{ "Help fill in Forever's numbers.", "/onecast report gives your catches and getaways as text, with the skill each happened at, to paste in a comment or a GitHub issue. Nobody has published Forever's real zone levels yet: shared reports let OneCast replace Classic's with Forever's own. It holds fishing numbers only, no name or realm." },
				{ "Data to share.", "When your fishing shows something OneCast doesn't know yet, such as a zone with no known level, a level that looks wrong or a fish somewhere new, chat says so once, and the minimap button counts it until you copy your report. The stats window's new Report button shows a green dot, the book's Zones tab marks those zones as new data, and the Zones and Camp tabs have a Share your data button." },

				{ "Spots on the map.", "Click a spot on the stats window's Zone tab to open the world map there, with a waypoint: where you fish from once you have, or else the spot's own place on the map, from the game's map data. City districts like Stormwind's canals aren't on it, so those learn their place as you fish them." },

				{ "Opening and closing the options.", "Opening OneCast's options from one of its windows no longer closes that window, or any other OneCast window. And options opened from OneCast (the minimap button, /onecast or a window's Options button) now just close, instead of leaving the game menu open. Opened from the game menu, they still go back to it." },

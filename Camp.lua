-- OneCast camp: Forever's fishing crafts for its wilderness camps, and the buffs they give.
--
-- Forever lets players build a campfire and place camp features by it. Fishing has three:
-- the Fish Bowl, the Fishing Rack and the Fishing Hut. Sitting by the fire for a minute gives
-- each feature's benefit for an hour; the Rack and the Hut give "Uncommon Fishing" and "Rare
-- Fishing", extra rewards while fishing. What those rewards are is decided by the server and
-- not published anywhere, so catches made under each buff are recorded here, to be shown in
-- the collection book's Camp tab and in /onecast report.
--
-- Everything below is from Forever's game data on wago.tools (build 1.60.1.70862): recipe and
-- item IDs, reagents, the Fishing each needs (the craft's skill-up level and the item's own
-- requirement), the 15-minute features, the hour-long buffs and the shared hour cooldown.
-- Where the Blueprints, the Fish Bowl recipe and Seasonal Fish Steaks come from isn't in it:
-- `blueprintFrom` is from player reports (10 November 2026). The Rack's Blueprint dropping from
-- Gelihast is reported by several guides, which disagree only on the drop rate. The Hut's
-- dropping from Jammal'an the Prophet is one player's report, via a Wowhead comment (13 November 2026).

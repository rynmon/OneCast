-- OneCast: one-button fishing for WoW Forever (interface 16001, modern addon API).
--
-- How it works, without secure snippets (loadstring_untainted is missing on Forever,
-- so SecureHandler templates are out):
--   * OneCastButton is a plain SecureActionButton that casts Fishing. Bind a key to it
--     in Options > Keybindings > AddOns > OneCast, or double right-click with a pole.
--   * When the Fishing channel starts, that same key is overridden to INTERACTTARGET
--     and soft-interact is switched on, so the next press reels in the bobber.
--   * When the channel ends the override is dropped and the key casts again.
-- Every cast and every reel is still one hardware press by the player.

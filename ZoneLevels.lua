-- Fishing skill needed in each zone so that no fish get away: the zone's fishing level + 95.
-- Lure and pole bonuses count towards it. Zone skill is set by the server, not the game data,
-- and no source has published Forever's own numbers yet (10 November 2026), so these are
-- Classic's, from CMaNGOS's Classic 1.12 world database (skill_fishing_base_level), which
-- AzerothCore's matches for every Classic zone. Badlands, Blasted Lands and Searing Gorge have
-- no level there: they have no water to fish. The stats window also counts real getaways per
-- zone, with the skill they happened at: they judge zones missing from this table, overrule
-- ZONE_FISHING_NOTE, and overrule this table too when a fish gets away at or above your
-- current skill.
-- Keyed by English zone name; ZoneNames.lua swaps them for the client's own at load.
